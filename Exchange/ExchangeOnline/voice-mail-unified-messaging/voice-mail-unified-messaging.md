# Voice mail in Exchange Online: Unified Messaging

Unified Messaging (UM) in Exchange Online has been retired. Cloud Voicemail replaces Exchange UM for providing voice messaging functionality for Teams and Exchange Online users. For more information, see [Set up Cloud Voicemail](/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail).

Cloud Voicemail is also the solution for Skype for Business Server 2019 voice users who have mailboxes on Exchange Server 2019 or Exchange Online. For more information on setting up Cloud Voicemail for Skype for Business Server 2019, see [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail).
